🌟 Overview: FishMating by mrsuffix 🌟

Welcome to FishMating, a feature-rich and immersive Minecraft plugin crafted for version 1.21.3+ and beyond! 🛠️✨ Written with care using the latest Bukkit/Paper APIs, this plugin transforms your oceans, rivers, and lakes into living, breathing ecosystems where fish can breed dynamically — just like land animals, but with a unique aquatic twist! 🐟❤️🌾

With FishMating, your players can interact with marine life in a whole new way: by simply tossing specific seeds into the water, they’ll attract nearby fish of matching types. Curious salmon, cod, pufferfish, and tropical fish will detect the seeds within a 5-block radius 🌱➡️🐠 and gracefully swim toward them. Upon reaching the seeds, each fish takes one seed and becomes breeding-ready, shown with charming heart particles ❤️✨. If two breeding-ready fish find each other within 30 seconds, they pair up just like in vanilla Minecraft animal breeding, spawning an adorable baby fish to join the aquatic family! 🐣🌊

But that’s just the start! 🧰 The plugin is deeply customizable thanks to the powerful config.yml:

⚙️ Fully adjustable settings:

    Change detection radius 🧭

    Customize breeding cooldowns and readiness time ⏱️

    Enable or disable particle effects and control their amount 🎇

    Define which seeds attract which fish types 🌱🐟

    Fine-tune advanced settings like natural growth, debug logging, and maximum tracked fish limits 🐠📊

Everything is built with performance and stability in mind. FishMating handles edge cases gracefully — from fish dying mid-breeding, seeds despawning, or large-scale aquatic events — all while keeping your server console clean and error-free ✅. Thanks to the breeding-success-rate setting, you can even add a touch of unpredictability to make breeding feel natural and dynamic. 🎲✨
